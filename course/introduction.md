============

What is Ruby
------------

Ruby is a dynamic, open source, object oriented and reflective programming language.  It runs on all types of platforms like Windows, Mac OS and all versions of UNIX. It is fully object oriented programming language. Everything is an object in Ruby.Ruby is considered to follow the principle of POLA (principle of least astonishment). It means that the language behaves in such a way to minimize the confusion for experienced users.

History of Ruby
---------------


Ruby was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

Matz wanted a language perfect for his needs:
    

 - Syntactically Simple
 - Truly Object-Oriented
 - Having Iterators and Closures
 - Exception Handling
 - Garbage Collection
 - Portable

According to its creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.


Features of Ruby
----------------

Ruby language has many features. Some of them are explained below:

 - Object-oriented
 - Flexibility
 - Expressive feature
 - Mixins
 - Visual appearance
 - Dynamic typing and Duck typing
 - Exception handling
 - Garbage collector
 - Portable
 - Keywords
 - Statement delimiters
 - Variable constants
 - Naming conventions
 - Keyword arguments
 - Method names
 - Singleton methods
 - Missing method
 - Case Sensitive

Advantages of Ruby
------------------

 - Ruby is an open-source and is freely available on the Web, but it is
   subject to a license.
   
 - Ruby is a general-purpose, interpreted programming language.
 - Ruby is a true object-oriented programming language.
 - Ruby is a server-side scripting language similar to Python and PERL.
 - Ruby can be used to write Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts.
 - Ruby can be embedded into Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
 - Ruby has a clean and easy syntax that allows a new developer to learn
   very quickly and easily.
 - Ruby has similar syntax to that of many programming languages such as
   C++ and Perl.
 - Ruby is very much scalable and big programs written in Ruby are   
   easily maintainable.
 - Ruby can be used for developing Internet and intranet applications.
 - Ruby can be installed in Windows and POSIX environments.
 - Ruby support many GUI tools such as Tcl/Tk, GTK, and OpenGL.
 - Ruby can easily be connected to DB2, MySQL, Oracle, and Sybase. Ruby 
   has a rich set of built-in functions, which can be used directly into
   Ruby scripts.

Disadvantages of Ruby
---------------------

 - Runtime Speed
 - Boot Speed
 - Documentation
 - Performance
 - Development

Similarities between Ruby and Python
------------

 1. They both are high level language.
 2. They both are server side scripting language.
 3. Both are used for web applications.
 4. Both work on multiple platforms.
 5. Both have clean syntax and are easily readable.
 6. Both use an interactive prompt called irb.
 7. Objects are strongly and dynamically typed.
 8. Both use embedded doc tools
